# xGBoost Modelia Data Challenge Example 

This program is an attempt to predict a yield anomaly using data from the 2018 Modelia Data Challenge.
The model was evaluated according to the AUC criteria, the winner got an AUC of 0.73, my first attempt, using a basic neural network, got 0.56.

This new script seems very effective, using cross validation it gets an AUC of 0.88. But it wasn't evaluated on the test data set, given that I don't have the results.
